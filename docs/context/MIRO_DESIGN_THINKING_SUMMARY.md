# Design Thinking Project Summary (Miro Export)

This document summarizes a multi‑week DD+ design thinking project to develop an AI‑powered mental health support application for high school students. It captures problem discovery, field research, insight synthesis, solution ideation, business modeling, and validation planning.

- Audience: internal contributors, reviewers, and agents needing high‑level context
- Scope: Weeks 2–12 (Problem finding → Reflection)
- Product focus: non‑clinical, privacy‑first, youth‑safe support spanning Chat (Talk), Quests/Programs, mood tracking, and coordination with schools/caregivers

---

## Week 2 — Project Introduction & Initial Problem Framing

- Team introductions; Mod 6 overview; emphasis on self‑management and collective decisions across a global team.
- Phase I (Solo): Problem Finding → each member generated 30 problem ideas (solution‑agnostic divergence).
- Phase III (Team): Problem Selecting using 3 categories to converge:
  - Category 1: Is it real? Unmet need, clear user, importance.
  - Category 2: Can you observe it? Access to research/interviews.
  - Category 3: Is it a good fit? Innovation space, alignment with team skills/interests.
- Selected area: Mental health for students (amended from “Mental Health” to enable broader, student‑centric exploration).
- Initial Point of View (POV) and needs highlighted: privacy, affordable access, adequate sleep, anonymous resources, prevention of risky/self‑harm behaviors, improved academic/social thriving, lifelong mental health.

---

## Week 3 — Field Research Planning

- Goal: Maximize divergence in solo observations; deep, contextual understanding.
- Users:
  - Extreme users: Novice (students facing challenges for the first time), Expert (school counselors/therapists).
  - Adjacent users: Teachers, parents, mentors.
- Recruitment: Social/professional networks, classmates, family, GenAI; stress anonymity, minimal burden, clear comms.
- Methods (IDEO refresher):
  - Observation‑focused: Fly on the Wall, A Day in the Life, Shadowing, POEMS.
  - Interview/Engagement‑focused: Guided Tour, Still Photo Survey, Personal Inventory, Extreme User Interview, Draw the Experience, Camera/Video Journal, Activity/Error Analysis.
- Contexts: School, home, online.
- Recording: Spreadsheets → easy Miro import.

Team plans (examples):
- Victoria Tan — Day in the Life (parents), Shadowing (students); novice/expert categorization.
- Ryoma Machida — Extreme User Interview (student + counselor), Guided Tour (counselor/teacher).
- Afsheen Shakoor — Draw the Experience (practitioners), POEMS (parents); stigma noted.
- Lokesh Garg — Guided Tour (professionals), A Day in the Life (students; daily triggers).
- Yunfeng Xie — Draw the Experience (students), Activity Analysis (counselors).

## Weeks 4–5 — Solo Research, Analysis, and Personas

- Activities: Conduct fieldwork, analyze observations, develop 2 composite personas (behavioral, not demographic), isolate ANRUM insights (Authentic, Non‑Obvious, Revealing about Unmet Needs). Reflect on attribution bias and assumptions.

Findings (illustrative):
- Ryoma — Isolation, need for private help; counselor pain: limited resources, early‑warning detection gaps. Personas: Experienced School Counselors; Supportive High School Teachers.
- Afsheen — Practitioners manage emotional strain/resource limits; Parents face stigma, cost, and helplessness. Personas: Mental Health Practitioners; Parents.
- Victoria — Single mother (Lisa) with son experiencing anxiety; inadequate system support; Personas: Mothers of young adults; Emily (17, introvert) under academic pressure and stigma.
- Yunfeng — Counselor (L.N, Liang) lacks qualified practitioners and practice pathways; Student (S, Zhang) needs private, trusted, affordable support vs peer/family pressure.
- Lokesh — Student (Harendra) overwhelmed by academics and isolation; Professional (Dr. Patel) advocates simplified care amidst high demand/limited resources.

## Week 6 — Insights Convergence & Problem Reframing

- Approach: Integrative thinking (not averaging) to synthesize solo insights.
- Top insights converged:
  1) Lack of accessible, affordable mental health resources.
  2) Need for integrated support systems and digital tools.
  3) Emotional resilience and peer support in high‑stress environments.
- Reframed into HMW:
  - "How might we integrate digital tools needed to make high school and university students facing academic pressure and mental health challenges have access to affordable resources that empower them to manage stress effectively and improve their well‑being?"
- Business context candidates:
  - Teladoc Health — expand school‑based services; assumptions: data availability, platform scalability, school integration, infra support.
  - Headspace — extend into institutional markets (schools/caregivers); mission alignment.

---

## Week 7 — Solution Concept Development

- Blueprinting + SCAMPER to assemble a testable concept.
- Value‑added steps:
  - Self‑assessment → Personalized feedback/recommendations → Adaptive learning & community → Continuous monitoring/follow‑ups.
- Digital enablers: Accessibility, data collection/analysis, customization, collaborative care, real‑time communication, continuity of care.
- SCAMPERed components:
  - Predictive Behavioral Insights Engine (ML‑driven, real‑time adjustments, feedback loops).
  - Dynamic Interactive Content Universe (personalized, interactive content).
  - Adaptive Interface via AI Assistants (voice, real‑time guidance, task automation).
  - Community Network (gamification, rewards, peer mentoring).
- Assumptions tracked: user willingness, privacy compliance, tech accessibility, stakeholder support.

---

## Week 8 — Storyboarding & Experimentation Plan

- Prototype storyboard of the SCAMPERed solution; experimentation plan to validate assumptions.
- Example hypotheses:
  - Engagement: "Interactive features + continuous feedback will increase engagement by 30% vs. traditional methods" → metric: interaction frequency.
  - Personalization efficacy: "AI adapts accurately to varied needs, improving outcomes" → metrics tied to actionable recommendations and user‑reported impact.
- Testing goals: support/refute hypotheses.
- Storyboard elements: People (students/assistants), Objects (devices/UI), Locations (home/school/private spaces), Interactions (assessment, feedback, community, gamification, reassessment).
- Experiment questions: qualitative (experience, relevance) + quantitative (reminder response counts, usage stats).
