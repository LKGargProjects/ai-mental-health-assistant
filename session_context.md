## Goal
Implement the Journaling feature.

## Current Status
A basic `JournalScreen` has been created and integrated into `main_screen.dart`. An attempt to hot restart the application failed due to an incorrect command (`flutter-cli hot-restart`).

## Last Action (Failed)
*   **Command:** `cd lokesh_s_application_replicated && flutter-cli hot-restart`
*   **Error:** `bash: flutter-cli: command not found`
*   **Learning:** The correct way to hot restart is to press 'R' in the `flutter run` terminal, not to use a separate command.

## Next Steps
1.  **Inform the user:** Explain that a hot restart needs to be triggered manually by pressing 'R' in the terminal where the app is running.
2.  **Continue Journal Feature Development:** Once the UI is verified, proceed with implementing the "add new entry" functionality.
