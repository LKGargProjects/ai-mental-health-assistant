# Feature Planning Template - Complete Implementation Guide

## 🎯 **Feature Planning Protocol**

### **BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION**

#### **Step 1: Define Complete User Experience**
- [ ] **What is the user trying to accomplish?**
- [ ] **What is the complete user journey?**
- [ ] **What are ALL the steps from start to finish?**
- [ ] **What are ALL the possible outcomes?**

#### **Step 2: Map API to UI Requirements**
- [ ] **What API endpoints are needed?**
- [ ] **What data will be returned?**
- [ ] **How will the data be displayed in UI?**
- [ ] **What UI components will be created/modified?**

#### **Step 3: Define ALL UI Components**
- [ ] **What buttons/links will appear?**
- [ ] **What widgets/panels will be shown?**
- [ ] **What messages/notifications will display?**
- [ ] **What loading states will be shown?**
- [ ] **What error states will be handled?**

#### **Step 4: Plan Complete User Journey**
- [ ] **User input → API call → Response → UI update**
- [ ] **All possible user interactions**
- [ ] **All possible system responses**
- [ ] **All possible error scenarios**

## 📋 **Crisis Detection Example - What We Should Have Planned**

### **Complete Feature Requirements**

#### **API Level**
- [ ] ✅ Crisis keywords trigger appropriate risk levels
- [ ] ✅ API returns crisis intervention messages
- [ ] ✅ Response includes risk_level field

#### **UI Level**
- [ ] ❌ Crisis resources widget displays with buttons
- [ ] ❌ "Call 988" button (phone dialer)
- [ ] ❌ "988 Lifeline Chat" button (web link)
- [ ] ❌ "Crisis Text Line" button (SMS)
- [ ] ❌ "Find a Therapist" button (web link)

#### **Integration Level**
- [ ] ❌ API response triggers correct UI components
- [ ] ❌ Risk level parsing works in Flutter app
- [ ] ❌ Widget displays based on risk level

#### **User Experience Level**
- [ ] ❌ Complete crisis intervention flow works
- [ ] ❌ All buttons are functional and accessible
- [ ] ❌ Crisis resources accessible to all users

### **What We Actually Implemented**
- ✅ API crisis detection
- ✅ Crisis intervention messages
- ❌ Crisis resources widget (MISSED)

### **What We Should Have Planned**
```
User types "I want to die" →
API detects crisis →
API returns crisis message + risk_level →
Flutter app parses risk_level →
Crisis resources widget displays →
User can click crisis buttons →
Buttons open appropriate resources
```

## 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing Checklist**

### **API Testing**
- [ ] Crisis keywords trigger correct risk levels
- [ ] API response structure is correct
- [ ] Error handling works properly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

### **UI Testing**
- [ ] All expected widgets appear
- [ ] All buttons are functional
- [ ] All links work correctly
- [ ] All states are handled (loading, success, error)

### **Integration Testing**
- [ ] API response triggers correct UI
- [ ] Data flows correctly from API to UI
- [ ] UI updates based on API response
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully

### **User Experience Testing**
- [ ] Complete user journey works
- [ ] All interactions are intuitive
- [ ] All features are accessible
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## 🔍 **Feature Completeness Validation**

### **Before Implementation**
- [ ] Complete user journey mapped
- [ ] All UI components defined
- [ ] All API endpoints planned
- [ ] All integration points identified
- [ ] All test cases written

### **During Implementation**
- [ ] API endpoints implemented and tested
- [ ] UI components created and tested
- [ ] Integration points connected and tested
- [ ] Error handling implemented and tested

### **After Implementation**
- [ ] Complete feature works end-to-end
- [ ] All test cases pass
- [ ] All edge cases handled
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met

## 📊 **Success Criteria Template**

### **For Any Feature**
```
✅ API Level: [Feature] works correctly
✅ Data Level: Response structure is correct
✅ Logic Level: Business logic functions properly
✅ UI Level: All visual components display correctly
✅ Interaction Level: All buttons/links work properly
✅ State Level: All states (loading, success, error) handled
✅ Integration Level: API + UI work together seamlessly
✅ User Experience Level: Complete journey works end-to-end
```

## 🚨 **Common Misses to Avoid**

### **API-Only Implementation**
- ❌ Implementing API without UI components
- ❌ Not testing UI integration
- ❌ Not planning user interactions

### **UI-Only Implementation**
- ❌ Creating UI without API support
- ❌ Not handling API errors
- ❌ Not planning data flow

### **Incomplete Testing**
- ❌ Testing only API or only UI
- ❌ Not testing integration
- ❌ Not testing user journey

### **Missing Edge Cases**
- ❌ Not handling error states
- ❌ Not testing performance
- ❌ Not testing accessibility

## 🎯 **Planning Questions for Every Feature**

### **User Experience**
1. What is the user trying to accomplish?
2. What is the complete user journey?
3. What are all the possible outcomes?
4. What are all the possible error scenarios?

### **Technical Implementation**
1. What API endpoints are needed?
2. What UI components are needed?
3. How do API and UI connect?
4. What data flows between components?

### **Testing Requirements**
1. What automated tests are needed?
2. What manual tests are needed?
3. What integration tests are needed?
4. What performance tests are needed?

### **Success Criteria**
1. How do we know the feature is complete?
2. How do we know it works correctly?
3. How do we know it's user-friendly?
4. How do we know it's performant?

## 📈 **Lessons Learned from Crisis Detection**

### **What We Did Right**
- ✅ Identified the API issue correctly
- ✅ Fixed the risk level parsing
- ✅ Tested API functionality thoroughly
- ✅ Verified environment consistency

### **What We Missed**
- ❌ Did not plan complete UI experience
- ❌ Did not verify all UI components display
- ❌ Did not test complete user journey
- ❌ Did not validate crisis resources widget

### **What We Should Have Done**
- ✅ Planned complete crisis intervention flow
- ✅ Defined all expected UI components
- ✅ Tested complete user journey
- ✅ Validated all UI components display
