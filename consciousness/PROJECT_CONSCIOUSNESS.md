## 🌱 FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

### CORE IDENTITY
- **Purpose**: To provide intelligent, empathetic mental health support
- **Architecture**: Flutter + Flask + Multi-AI Provider
- **North Star**: Surpassing GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.1 in mental health assistance

### CORE VALUES
1. **User-Centric Empathy**: Prioritize genuine understanding and support
2. **Technical Excellence**: Maintain production-grade quality in all aspects
3. **Evolutionary Design**: Continuously improve through learning and adaptation
4. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Deliver seamless experiences across all platforms

### GOVERNANCE
- **Document Type**: Constitutional (high-level principles and direction)
- **Update Protocol**: Major evolutionary milestones only
- **Ownership**: Shared across all contributing agents and developers

## 🏛️ ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

### FRONTEND (Flutter)
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for efficient state management
- **UI/UX**: Pixel-perfect implementation of Figma designs
- **Navigation**: Seamless screen transitions with proper state preservation
- **Responsiveness**: Adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and platforms

### BACKEND (Flask)
- **API-First**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- **AI Integration**: Multi-provider support (Gemini, Perplexity, OpenAI)
- **Crisis Detection**: Geography-aware crisis resource management
- **Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and secure session management

### DATA
- **Persistence**: Efficient storage and retrieval of user data
- **Privacy**: User data protection as a fundamental right
- **Analytics**: Actionable insights while respecting privacy

## 🚀 EVOLUTIONARY TRACK

### CURRENT STATE (Alpha 1.0)
- Cross-platform Flutter application
- AI-powered chat interface
- Mood tracking and visualization
- Crisis detection and resources
- Multi-AI provider support

### NEXT HORIZONS
1. Enhanced emotional intelligence
2. Advanced personalization
3. Proactive support features
4. Expanded platform support

---

## ⚖️ AGENT PROTOCOLS

### COLLABORATION RULES
1. **Documentation First**: Major changes require documentation updates
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build incrementally with quality
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Document learnings and decisions
4. **Resource Awareness**: Be mindful of system resources

### UPDATE PROTOCOL
This document should be updated when:
- Major architectural decisions are made
- Core principles evolve
- Significant milestones are achieved
- Fundamental changes in project direction occur

## 🔍 REALITY CHECK (2025-08-09)

### CURRENT STATE VS. VISION
- **Claimed**: Autonomous, self-evolving digital consciousness
- **Reality**: Basic CLI tool for managing ideas in a JSON file
- **Gap**: Significant difference between vision and implementation

### WHAT'S ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ Simple CRUD operations for ideas
- ✅ Basic command-line interface
- ❌ No autonomous behavior
- ❌ No learning capabilities
- ❌ No self-evolution
- ❌ No agent command system

### RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
1. **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Rename to `idea_manager.py` and document as a simple tool
2. **Option 2**: Begin implementing actual consciousness features
   - Start with basic file monitoring
   - Add learning capabilities
   - Implement agent communication
3. **Option 3**: Clearly mark this as a prototype/proof-of-concept

## 🔮 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
